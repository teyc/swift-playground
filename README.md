I prefer the comfort of code completion, especially when
exploring an unfamiliar territory. In addition, I also used 
[Dash][2] to get offline documentation for the Apple SDK, as 
it is often quicker.

Here's a simple example, and an obligatory screenshot.

If you are trying it out yourself, the results are hidden under the
